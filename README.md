# React + Tailwind test
Prototype app made with the following technologies:
- [React](https://it.reactjs.org/)
- [React router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
- [React hooks](https://it.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#which-versions-of-react-include-hooks)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
- [Hero icons](https://heroicons.dev/)
- [Json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Demo
Test things locally by installing dependancies with `npm i`and run the local development environment with `npm run mock` for running the json server and then `npm start` for starting the React app. 

## Bugs
- Uhm, many...!
